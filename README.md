# Stock Pricing Prediction Using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for stock pricing prediction using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The prediction model leverages various financial models and simulations, such as Exponential Growth, Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS), and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the required Python packages installed before running the script. You can install them using the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install vectorbt --quiet
pip install yfinance --quiet
pip install -U lppls --quiet
